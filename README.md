# Nonparametric Methods on Framingham Heart Study
*** Written in R

Our analysis of Framingham Heart Study is based on a subset of data that includes 17 variables when participants first participated the study back in 1948. 

We mainly studied the relationship between a binary response variable (10-yr Coronary Heart Disease) and 14 risk factors, including five qualitative variables and nine quantitative variables.

We explored whether non-smokers have a higher survival rate than smokers and whether the female has a higher survival rate than the male using Survival Analysis. 

We performed three correlation tests and two-sample tests between 10-yr CHD and significant quantitative variables (Age, Weight, Cholesterol). We studied association between qualitative variables and 10-yr CHD using Fisherâ€™s exact test.
